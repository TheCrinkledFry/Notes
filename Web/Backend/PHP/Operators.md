# Operators

When it comes to the operators offered, these are the exact same all other languages with:

- +
- -
- %
- /
- *

- ** --> only one that is different and works like python



Can use the shorthand assignment stuff too like the +=, -=, *=, etc. The only one unique one is can also do .= since this will be the short hand for concating two strings together.
