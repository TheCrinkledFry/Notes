# Ternary

This is just an alternative way to write the if statements using the ? sign and the syntax is `$variable = condition ? true result : false result;`

### Ternary Single

```php
<?php
  $x = 40;
  $total = ($x === 40) ? "Correct": "Wrong";
  echo "Item Price: " .  ($x > 20 ? "Expensive" : "Affordable");
```



### Nested Ternary

```php
<?php
  
```
