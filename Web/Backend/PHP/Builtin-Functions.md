# Builtin Functions

1. `define("const name", any value)` --> This will create a constant at runtime unlike using the normal *const* keyword which can only be done at compile time.
2. `var_dump(variable name)` --> This will return information about the variable passed in like value assigned to it and data type. This will not tell if it is a constant or not.
3. `die(optional single argument)` --> This is used to stop the execution of the program right there and then. This is an alias for another function called **exit()**. Calling either of these functions will do the same thing.
4.
