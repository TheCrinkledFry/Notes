# Builtin Functions

1. `define("const name", any value)` --> This will create a constant at runtime unlike using the normal *const* keyword which can only be done at compile time.
2. `var_dump(variable name)` --> This will return information about the variable passed in like value assigned to it and data type. This will not tell if it is a constant or not.
3. `die(optional single argument)` --> This is used to stop the execution of the program right there and then. This is an alias for another function called **exit()**. Calling either of these functions will do the same thing.
4. `array(any number of arguemnts)` --> This is used to make an array
5. `is_bool(boolean variable)` --> This is used to check if the variable is of a Boolean type. Will return 1 if it is and 0 otherwise.
6. `is_int(integer variable)` --> This is used to check of the variable is of an integer type. Will return 1 if it is and 0 otherwise.
7. `is_float(float variable)` --> This is used to check of the variable is of a float type. Will return 1 if it is and 0 otherwise.
8. `is_string(string variable)` --> This is used to check of the variable is of a string type. Will return 1 if it is and 0 otherwise.
9. `strlen(string variable)` --> This is used to get the length of a string
10. `unset(variable name)` --> This will set the variable to *null* regardless of its original value.
11. `is_null(variable name)` --> This is used to check of the variable is of a null type. Will return true if it is and false otherwise.
