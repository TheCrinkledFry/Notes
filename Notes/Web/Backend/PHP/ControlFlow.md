# Control Flow

Just like other languages, PHP has the basic control flow like:

- if
- if else
- else
- switch



### if statements

When it comes to this, it is basically the same as C.

```php
<?php
  $x = 50;
  if ($x === 50){
  	return "this is a good thing";
  }

  if ($x === 30)
    echo "single thing";
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Just like in C, if there is only one statement will be executed there is no need to put the curly braces.

> [!CAUTION]

> Huh



### if-else if

```php
<?php
  $x = 50;

  if ($x === 23){
  	echo "yes";
  }
  else if ($x === 50){
      echo "no";
  }
```

Tut

### if-else

```php
<?php
  $x = 50;

  if ($x === 50){
	echo "yay";
  }
  else {
   	echo "maybe";
  }
```
